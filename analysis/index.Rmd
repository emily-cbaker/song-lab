    This website is dedicated to the work I conduct at the Song Laboratory at the Arizona State University School of Life Sciences. Documented on this site are all of the projects I have previously or currently am working on, along with documentation of pipeline installation, error correction, and a glossary of bioinformatics terminology for quick reference.
  </p>

  There are links for almost every software and package used on this site if you wish to view the original documentation. For installation and execution, all programs I have previously run at Texas A&M have seperate pages with the workflows I used on the Grace cluster. However, any new workflows will only have configurations for the ASU Sol cluster documented. While these clusters are both run on a slurm scheduler, there are slight differences in their execution such that I found it worth maintaining both sets of instructions. Please keep this in mind when reviewing the workflow pages.
