## In-silico Protein Structure Prediction {.tabset}

### What is AlphaFold?

AlphaFold is a software created by Google DeepMind that predicts protein structure based solely off of the primary structure of the protein (amino acid sequence). Additionally, you may predict multi-mer structures and proteins with the addition of certain ligands available in the AlphaFold data set. 

Currently, the third release of the program, aptly anmed AlphaFold3, is the latest edition.

#### Limitations
As of April 2025, the daily limit for the number of jobs per account is 30. If you require a higher threshhold of jobs, you will have to obtain a contract with DeepMind for this level of access. However, 30 jobs is plenty for a large portion of researchers.

One of AlphaFold's biggest limitations is the software's unreliability in predicting highly dynamic regions of a protein. Commonly, when you put in a protein with large areas of dynamic activity, AlphaFold will tend to force the structure into an alpha-helix shape. I tend to see it in my analysis when trying to model a protein with some sort of anchoring mechanism, as these regions are inherently dynamic.

This is of less concern when not working with proteins with majority highly dynamic structures, but it is certainly a property to be aware of.

### How to Use

The main function of AlphaFold is the prediction of protein structures. To perform this prediction, simply visit the website [alphafoldserver.com](alphafoldserver.com) and copy-paste your protein's sequence into the interface provided. 

This run will produce 2 figures: a 3-D prediction color-coded by pIDTT scores and a pAE graph. Interoretation 2 graphs are discussed under the *Analysis of Predictions* tab of this page.

### Analysis of Predictions

#### pIDDT
The main figure that AlphaFold produces is a generated image of the predicted structure, along with color-coordinated scores of confidence called pIDDT scores. Dark blue indicated a very high pIDDT score, light blue a moderately high score, yellow is low, and orange is extremely low. 

The pIDDT score indicates AlphaFold's confidence in its generation of the protein's structure. In the example below, you can see region of high certainty within the center of the protein, but lower certainty along the alpha-heix that is along the back part of the loop extended out from the main structure.

#### pAE Plots

The pAE plots produced by AlphaFold indicate the model's confidence that of the relative position of a given region of the protein, in reference to the rest of the structure. Along the x- and y-axes we have the nucleotide bases of the protein from start to end. The intersection of 2 points indicates AlphaFold's certainty of those 2 regions positions relative to each other.

This plot is important because there are many groups extending off of the main structure of the protein, and these groups can interact and cause the protein to change shape.

  Commonly, regions that are further from each other have lower scores of certainty, and region close together score highly. Notice the dark line going from the top left corner of the graph to the bottom right. This is the relative position of each bases' position relative to itself (which is always certain), so this dark green line should *always* be in the pAE plot.
