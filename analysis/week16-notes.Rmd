10/1 : NCBI has finally sent over the missing protein file for the Colorado *Anabrus Simplex*, so I have begun running OrthoFinder on it as well. The Idaho genome is almost finished going through OrthoFinder as well, I just need to submit the 5th batch job of Barkdull's pipeline to Grace. This step has been delayed because every time I try to submit the job, the cluster is overloaded and rejects it.
